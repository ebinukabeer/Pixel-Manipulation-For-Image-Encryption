Image Encryption and Decryption
This project demonstrates a simple approach to image encryption and decryption using Python. It shows how an image can be transformed using encryption techniques and later decrypted to retrieve the original visual content.

Project Overview
Encrypts an image using basic image manipulation techniques.
Decrypts the encrypted image to retrieve the original version.
Displays side-by-side comparison of original, encrypted, and decrypted images.
Technologies Used
Python
OpenCV (cv2)
NumPy
Jupyter Notebook / Python Script

How It Works
Encryption:
Each pixel's value is modified using a simple algorithm (e.g., bitwise NOT, XOR with a key, or color inversion).
Decryption:
The encryption process is reversed to get back the original image.
